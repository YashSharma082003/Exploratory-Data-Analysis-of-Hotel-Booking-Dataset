# Hotel Booking Dataset
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### What is EDA? Why do we do EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, test hypotheses and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, and patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summaries and graphical representations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis involved two steps:-
● Data Analysis (Data Pre-processing, Cleaning and Manipulation).

● Data Visualisation (Visualize relationships in data using different types of plots).
